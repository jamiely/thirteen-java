How To Play 13

Objective: 
To play all cards, leaving none in your possession.

Play Procedure:
Players take turns in a clockwise direction, playing
cards that will beat the controlling hand. If there
is no controlling hand, then a player may play any
legal hand.

Rules
1. You may play only a legal hand on your turn.
2. You may skip on your turn.
3. If you have no legal hands to play, you must skip.
4. If you start a new round, you may play any type of hand.
5. A new round starts when every other player has skipped
   his turn, besides the player currently in control.
6. A legal hand is a hand of the same type as the 
   controlling hand, whose high card beats that of the
   controlling hand.
7. The only exception to the "same type" rule is that
   any single 2 can be beaten by a cut, and any pair
   of 2's can be beaten by a super cut.
8. Who Starts?
   a. Play most often starts with the holder of the 3 of
      spades. That player may choose to play any playable
      hand containing that card.
   b. Alternatively, play can begin with the winner of the
      last game, who can choose to lead with any playable
      hand.
